# FairfaxTailorsMobile
A mobile app to showcase the products of Fairfax Tailors.

## Developing

This app runs on port 19002 if used with Expo. It will build the app before deploying it live on your device. Expo has the benefit of not requiring your external device to be plugged in while running it with react native requires either the virtual image to be present or your external device to be plugged in.

For both cases you must **navigate to the FairfaxTailors folder through command line.**

### React Native Method
#### Android Virtual Device
1. Go to the Android Studio application
2. Click the AVD Manager button on the top ribbon
3. Click play on one of the virtual devices or click "Create Virtual Device..." and follow the prompts
4. Open your custom app on your virtual device
5. In command line type "**react-native run-android**"

### Expo Method
To run the application on your phone without plugging it in: 
1. Type "**expo start**" on the command line on your computer
2. Download the expo app on your android or iphone
3. Scan the qr code with your mobile device (within the app if android and camera app if iPhone)
